Case 2: PRODSUP-002:

Hi. I added my project to CircleCI but I can’t get the build complete. I’m not sure what I’m doing wrong. Can you help? My project is https://github.com/nym2015/commons-csv.

Hello Jolene,

After investigating your issue and I've found something which is not clear to me at all. I need clarification for below arguments.

commons-csv/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/csv/CSVFormat.java  : 795
----------------------------------------------------------------
/**
* Verifies the consistency of the parameters and throws an IllegalArgumentException if necessary.
*
* @throws IllegalArgumentException
*/
private void validate() throws IllegalArgumentException {
for (int i=0; i<20*60*60; i++) {
    System.out.print('.');
    try {
        Thread.currentThread().sleep(1000);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        break;
    }
}

The execution taking too many times to comolete because of for loop.
Infact, I've removed it just for troubleshoot and tests pass. Do ensure that it works as expected.
