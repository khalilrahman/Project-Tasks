Case 1: PRODSUP-001:


Hi. I am trying to get my test cases to show up on CircleCI but it is not working. I have a fork of this project in my github account https://github.com/mtedone/podam. I added the project to CircleCI and got a green build but the Test Results tab is empty

Case 1: PRODSUP-001: Regarding Test Cases Show Up Issue.

Hello Harry,

After investigating the issue, I found following things;
<> Create a circle.yml with required inputs.
<> Enable Maven Surefire Plugin in pom.xml file in podam directory
remove below code only at line 279:

<configuration>
   <skip>true</skip>
</configuration>


<> Clear circle.yml file and add below lines:

test:
  post:
    - mkdir -p $CIRCLE_TEST_REPORTS/junit/
    - find . -type f -regex ".*/target/surefire-reports/.*xml" -exec cp {} $CIRCLE_TEST_REPORTS/junit/ \;
